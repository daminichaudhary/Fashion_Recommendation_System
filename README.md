# Fashion_Recommendation_System

## Overview

This project aims to develop a Fashion Recommendation System using deep learning and computer vision techniques. The system extracts features from fashion images using a pre-trained VGG16 model and recommends similar items to users, enhancing the online shopping experience. The primary goal is to provide personalized fashion suggestions, making the shopping process intuitive and engaging.

## Problem Statement

In the rapidly evolving e-commerce sector, offering personalized product recommendations is vital for improving customer satisfaction and increasing sales. The fashion industry, in particular, requires robust solutions to suggest relevant products to users based on their visual preferences. This project addresses this challenge by developing a recommendation system that analyzes fashion images and provides visually similar product suggestions.

## Features

- **Image Feature Extraction**: Uses pre-trained VGG16 model to extract visual features from fashion images.
- **Similarity Measurement**: Employs cosine similarity to identify and recommend items similar to the input image.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI for users to input their favorite fashion items and receive recommendations.

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset of fashion images that includes various categories such as clothing, shoes, and accessories. The images are preprocessed and fed into the VGG16 model for feature extraction.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Programming language used for implementation.
- **TensorFlow & Keras**: For building and utilizing the deep learning model.
- **VGG16**: Pre-trained convolutional neural network used for image feature extraction.
- **NumPy & Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## How to Use

1. Prepare your dataset of fashion images.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Fashion_Recommendation_System.py` to extract features and get recommendations.
3. Use the provided functions to input an image and receive a list of recommended items.

## Project Structure

- `Fashion_Recommendation_System.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the implementation of the recommendation system.
- `women fashion.zip`: Directory containing sample fashion images used for testing and evaluation.

## Results

The recommendation system effectively suggests visually similar fashion items based on the input image. The feature extraction process captures essential visual attributes that help in matching items accurately.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with a web interface for real-time recommendations.
- Expansion of the dataset to include more diverse fashion categories.
- Implementation of advanced deep learning models for improved recommendation accuracy.
